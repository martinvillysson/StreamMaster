> A comprehensive IPTV management platform for organizing and streaming public broadcast content through Plex DVR, Emby, and Jellyfin Live TV 

## Quick Start 🚀

> [!TIP]  
> The wonderful [IPTV-org project](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv) maintains a list of publicly available channels from all over the world 🌍📺 
> 
> TV logos are also publicly available in the [tv-logos repository](https://github.com/tv-logo/tv-logos)

### Docker Compose Example:
```yaml
services:
  streammaster:
    image: ghcr.io/carlreid/streammaster:latest

    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:

```

> [!NOTE]

## Original Project 📝

This repository is a fork of the original SenexCrenshaw/StreamMaster project, which was deleted in early 2025 for unknown reasons. The vast majority of the project was written and created by SenexCrenshaw, so all credit for the core functionality and design goes to SenexCrenshaw.

This fork aims to preserve the project and ensure its continued availability to the community. We've focused on maintaining compatibility for existing users while making necessary updates for current technologies and addressing security concerns. The project welcomes community contributions as we move forward with modest, targeted improvements.
